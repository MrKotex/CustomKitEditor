# CustomKitEditor


CustomKitEditor is an add-on for the StrikePractice plugin. Now, players can make their CustomKits in their inventory instead of Gui. They are given Gamemode Creative and the ability to choose if they want to fight on horses or if they should be able to build during the fight.

For any further questions, ask me on the SP discord server or send a message to **@timury**.
## Features

Commands:
- **ck edit** - teleports player to the EditRoom
- **ck save** - saves player inventory to the config
- **ck settings** - saves kit's settings to the config
